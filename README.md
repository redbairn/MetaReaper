MetaReaper
==========

MetaReaper was a Software Engineering Project that involved the creation of a Metasearch engine. 

A Metasearch engine is a search tool that sends a userâ€™s query to multiple search engines and aggregates 
the results into a single list or displays them according to their source. A Metasearch engine combines 
a much more comprehensive results list.

This was a project for self study and it involved students using the languages, tools and applications 
that they have worked with earlier in the MSc course at UCD. For my implementation of the metasearch engine, 
I used PHP, and CSS and HTML for the layout and structure of the GUI.
